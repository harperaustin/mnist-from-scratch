#  MNIST Digit Classification from Scratch

This project tackles the classic MNIST handwritten digit classification task **without using any machine learning libraries**. That means no TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn â€” everything was built manually using only NumPy and raw Python. I also recorded the entire process to explain how everything works step-by-step.

##  Project Overview

-  Built a **fully connected neural network** from scratch
- Implemented:
  - Forward and backward propagation
  - Manual gradient descent
  - Weight initialization and updates
  - One-hot encoding
  - Softmax output layer
  - Cross-entropy loss
- Achieved over **84% accuracy** on the test set
- Recorded the process for educational purposes
